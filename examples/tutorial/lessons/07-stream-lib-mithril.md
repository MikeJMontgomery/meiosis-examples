## 07 - Stream Library

In the previous lesson, [06 - Scan](06-scan-mithril.html), we improved our `stream` implementation
by supporting an initial value, and we implemented `scan`. With `scan` being a great fit for our
reactive loop, we used it for our setup code.

### Use a stream library or your own implementation - it's your choice!

Hopefully, having implemented a simple stream with `map` and `scan` has solidified your
understanding of how we use them to set up the Meiosis pattern.
