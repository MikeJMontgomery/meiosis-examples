## 00 - Introduction

Welcome to the Meiosis Tutorial!

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain the Meiosis pattern from the ground up, hopefully
without assuming too much prior knowledge beyond the basics of JavaScript.

### Prerequisites

Besides JavaScript, you will need to know, or learn, about the view library that you would
like to use. This tutorial is offered in two versions: one with
[React](https://reactjs.org), and one with [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org).

### View Libraries

If neither of those is your preferred view library, fear not! It is trivial to use just about
any view library with the Meiosis pattern, whether it's a virtual DOM library or even
libraries such as [lit-html](http://meiosis.js.org/examples/setup/lit-html/index.html)
and [hyperHTML](http://meiosis.js.org/examples/setup/hyperHTML/index.html).

### JSX or hyperscript

Also note that if you prefer the [JSX](https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/what-is-jsx) syntax,
you should read the React version. Again, it is simple to use another view library, such as
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/), and so on.

If you prefer the [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) syntax, please read
the Mithril version of the tutorial. Other view libraries such as
[snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom), [domVM](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm),
and other hyperscript view libraries are also easy to use with Meiosis.

### Embedded Code Examples

The best way to learn is to practice! So, all code examples for this tutorial are embedded
into the page using [Flems](https://github.com/porsager/flems), so that you can edit the
code and see the results right there in the page. In fact, I strongly encourage you to try
things out with the code, this will help you understand how things work.

Finally, also note that you can also download and run the code examples for this tutorial,
as well as _all_ the Meiosis examples, by cloning the
[github repository](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples).

Let's get started! Please continue with either the
[01 - Hello World - React](01-hello-world-react.html) or the
[01 - Hello World - Mithril](01-hello-world-mithril.html) version.
