## 13 - Object Function Update

In the previous lesson, [12 - Function Update](12-func-update-mithril.html), we looked at a more
flexible way of issuing updates, namely by passing functions to `update()`.

The majority of the Meiosis examples use this strategy. However, there is a slightly different
way that is even more flexible. We'll look at it here, and see a use case where it simplifies
our code.

Here is the example:
